# Image presenter JavaFX program
This is a simple Java program that lets you present images. This was the chosen project that Macintosh_Fan did for capstone 12.

## Potential issue
* As you import some images, they may appear to have the wrong orientation, and that is due to the metadata that is used to make it appear upright beforehand; in that case, it is recommended to use a program, such as GIMP, to fix that for you (clearing EXIF rotation data).
